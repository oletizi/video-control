# spec-governance orchestration (T007/T008/T009/T014/T019) — THIN SHIM.
#
# The audit-protocol orchestration is single-sourced in `stackctl govern`
# (govern consolidation). This shim resolves the bundled stackctl and execs
# `stackctl govern --mode spec`, forwarding every flag and the GOVERN_* env the
# TS side reads. The spec-mode payload (spec + plan fold, checkpoint scoping),
# slush, and convergence gate all live in the single-sourced TS orchestration.
#
# Branches only on the spec text + feature slug, NEVER on which tool authored
# the spec (Principle III / FR-003). Fails loud if the audit capability is
# absent — no silent skip (Principle V / FR-005).
#
# Env (read by the TS side; documented here for the shim's adopters):
#   GOVERN_FEATURE_SLUG  (optional override; else derived from feature/<slug>)
#   GOVERN_SPEC_PATH     (optional; else derived from the CLAUDE.md SPECKIT marker)
#   GOVERN_PLAN_PATH     (optional; when set — the after_plan checkpoint — the plan is folded; FR-013)
#   GOVERN_CHECKPOINT    (optional; checkpoint label; defaulting GOVERN_CHECKPOINT > after_plan-if-plan > after_clarify)
#   GOVERN_REPO_ROOT     RETIRED (specs/installation-isolation R2): setting it is a
#                        loud FATAL. Anchoring contract: every argument to this shim is
#                        forwarded verbatim to `stackctl govern` (the exec below carries
#                        "$@"), so pass `--at <dir>` (the installation enclosing <dir>)
#                        as an ARGUMENT — `govern-spec.sh --at <dir>` — or run with the
#                        cwd inside the installation (the default walk-up start).
#   GOVERN_MODELS        (optional; comma-list passed to audit-barrage --models)
#   GOVERN_CEILING       (optional; convergence iteration ceiling, FR-014)
#   GOVERN_OVERRIDE      (optional; recorded override reason, FR-010)
#   GOVERN_NO_SLUSH      (optional; =1 disables the slush step)
#   GOVERN_PAYLOAD_BUDGET (optional; soft byte budget for the fold)
#   GOVERN_BARRAGE_BIN   (optional; the barrage entrypoint; default: bundled stackctl) — test seam

# Resolve the bundled stackctl from the repo root so this shim works BOTH in the

# GOVERN_STACKCTL overrides (tests / non-standard layout). Adopter packaging is
# tracked under design/migrate-scope-discovery.
